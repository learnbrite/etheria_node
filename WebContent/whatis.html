	<div class="contentheader">The First Decentralized Virtual World & Crypto-Real Estate</div>
	<p>
		Etheria is a virtual world where players can own tiles, farm them for blocks (think LEGO bricks), and build things with them. The entire state of the world is held in and all player actions are made through the decentralized, trustless Ethereum blockchain.  
	</p>
	<div class="contentheader nontop">Why does decentralization matter?</div>
	<p>
		Every virtual world you've ever visited is ultimately controlled by a single entity. The state of Etheria, on the other hand, is "agreed to" by the participants of the Ethereum network. This has several important ramifications:
		<ol>
			<li><span class="list_item_emphasis">Etheria cannot be taken down.</span> Not by the government, not by its owner-players, not even by the developer (me). Etheria will exist as long as Ethereum does.</li>
			<li><span class="list_item_emphasis">Likewise, Etheria cannot be censored or altered against the wishes of its owner-players.</span></li>
			<li><span class="list_item_emphasis">Open execution.</span> The Etheria code is not only open-source, it is open-execution. We know exactly what code is running and what it does.</li>
			<li><span class="list_item_emphasis">One world, many interfaces.</span> The "explore" feature of this website is only one of many possible graphical representations of Etheria. Anyone can build their own and I hope they do!</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<div class="contentheader nontop">How do I play?</div>
	<p>
		Etherians can take the following actions:
		<ol>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Buy unowned land tiles for 1 ETH each</li>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Farm tiles for 20 blocks, once every 12 hours (~2500 Ethereum blocks)</li>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Move and stack their blocks on their tile</li>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Change the color of their blocks</li>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Name their tile or group of tiles</li>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Set a "status" of each tile. This status will go out on the @ethereum_feed Twitter account. (To prevent spam, this costs 1 ETH.)</li> 
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Place/withdraw offers on already-owned land tiles</li>
			<li class="list_item_emphasis">Accept incoming offers on land they own</li>
		</ol>

	<div class="contentheader nontop">Motivation, Background and Future</div>
	<p>
		The "awesomeness" (for lack of a better term) of the real world is static. By contrast, the "awesomeness" of virtual worlds is steadily increasing, maybe even exponentially. 
		I believe that, eventually, virtual worlds will become so much better (safer, more efficient, more amazing, less expensive, etc) than the real world, humans will spend most of their lives in them. Many already do. Just ask a WoW addict.
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact, one of the possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox states that maybe alien civilzations are engrossed in virtual worlds and no longer pay much attention to the real one.
	</p>
	<p> 
		I also believe that like Ebay, Twitter or WhatApp, it's likely that network effects will lead to one dominant virtual world where people have their friends, family, possessions and maybe even livelihoods. Escaping it would be nearly impossible. Whoever controls it would have 100% total information about its inhabitants at all times.
	</p>
	<p>
		That prospect scares me.
	</p>
	<p> 
		Obviously, Etheria is a very primitive first step and I don't expect it to become this "dominant virtuosocial network", but I believe it is an important milestone in offering an alternative to whatever Facebook and Google come up with in the next few years.
